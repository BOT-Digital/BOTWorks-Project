# 🤖 BOTWorks

**An MCP-Powered App Built in Expo + Azure Functions**  
A unified framework where agents, design, and logic come together — powered by the **MO Concept** and driven from a single structured file.

## 🚧 Project Status: Paused (In Development)

BOTWorks is an AI-guided mobile app framework based on **Multi-Agent Collaborative Prompting (MCP)** — a system where agents don't just assist, they collaborate.

The concept is active, but development is currently paused due to bandwidth. Feel free to follow, fork, or reach out if you’re interested in building with MCP logic.

## 💡 What Is BOTWorks?

BOTWorks is built around a single principle:  
> **Everything — from goals to UI to agent prompts — is structured in one file.**

The entire experience is scaffolded from a single YAML definition called the **MO Concept**. This includes:

- Agent behavior & conversation paths  
- User goal intake & triage  
- Interface layout & emotional design logic  
- Visual theming & spacing systems  

It’s not a typical app. It’s a **living system**, where human intention meets structured agent support.

## 🧠 The MO Concept (Framework Pillars)

BOTWorks runs on a modular logic file that defines:

- **Connection Constant** — Core behavioral model (Action, Power, Change)  
- **Experience Pillars** — Emotional feedback loops and choice mechanics  
- **Goal Blueprinting** — Structured intent capture with evolving task states  
- **Response Interfaces** — Sliders, chat panels, and micro-animated inputs  
- **Visual System** — Sharp-edged UI with themed tokens and motion layers  
- **Conversation Patterns** — High / Low / Neutral agent guidance strategies  
- **Build Phases** — Roadmapped in four stages from scaffold to polish
